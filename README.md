### Hola!ðŸ‘‹ mi nombre es AndrÃ©s Lobo
I am also called skol25 on GitHub.

### Â¿who i am?
I am a full-stack developer with 3 years of experience.

Since I entered the world of programming, starting with C++ as my first language, I saw that there were other branches of programming, such as web development, and I haven't stopped learning since.

### Â¿What do i do now?
Currently, I am working on projects individually, either to try out new technologies or to do projects for other people as a freelancer. This way, I can develop skills that facilitate problem-solving until I find a job in web development where I can apply my knowledge and continue learning.

### Where am I heading?
My goal is to make an impact in every place I work, so I can gain a significant amount of experience and eventually develop my own technologies in the future.

### What technologies do I use?
Since I started in web programming, I haven't stopped learning languages and technologies that I currently use.

like:
  -javaScript
  -TypeScript
  -Node.js
  -React.js
  -Angular
  -Express
  -postgreSql
  -MongoDb
  -mongoose
  -sequelize
  -Git
  -HTML
  -CSS
  -SASS
  
Among other tools, I use Trello for team task organization and Figma for the visual design of a web page. I was able to learn most of these tools thanks to the Henry Bootcamp, where I also developed my skills and applied them in a team environment.
